What Is Assemblage? The whole basis for the app is in Matthew 18:20 where we are called to assemble to rejoice in the presence of God. Assemblage is a platform used to bring people together to study God's word not only to further understand Him but to strengthen a relationship with him while at the same time strengthening the relationship with the body of Christ.

Assemblage is a Bible study group management software. Where a user can create or join a Bible study group. There are different features that make it easy to get into a group.

Why did I want to make this app? Glad you asked. I found out that joining a Bible study group was a lot harder and daunting than I thought you would either have to go through a church or know people who are in a group already. This seemed way too difficult than it should be. Getting to Know God and the body of Christ should be easy. So that's why I wanted to make this app.


Here is the messaging side of the app which holds all of the user's groups and conversations.
